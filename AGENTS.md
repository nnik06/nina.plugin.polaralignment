# Repository Guide

## Scope

This repository contains the N.I.N.A. "Three Point Polar Alignment" plugin, its NUnit test project, a headless qualification core, and a qualification CLI.

- `PolarAlignment/`: main plugin project (`net8.0-windows7.0`, WPF, `NINA.Plugin` package).
- `NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment.Test/`: test project for geometry, refraction, control, safety, and qualification behavior.
- `QualificationCore/`: BCL/Newtonsoft-only `net8.0` qualification library shared by the plugin and headless CLI. Its files and project must be committed atomically with any source moves out of `PolarAlignment/`.
- `tools/TppaQualificationCli/`: headless qualification/evidence CLI; it references `QualificationCore` as a project and must not source-glob private working-tree files.
- `plate-solved-field-calculator.py`: offline Astropy helper used to derive reference coordinates for tests and math validation.

## Architecture

- `PolarAlignment/Instructions/PolarAlignment.cs`: core workflow. This is the sequence item implementation and the real runtime entry point for the plugin logic.
- `QualificationCore/NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment.QualificationCore.csproj`: headless qualification boundary. Plugin, tests, and CLI consume it by `ProjectReference`; do not restore source globs.
- `PolarAlignment/TppaFastAlignmentExecutionBudget.cs`: shared operational
  iteration ceiling and legacy timing-estimation helpers. The live route allows
  at most twelve freshly measured correction moves; elapsed time is telemetry
  while field convergence is being established.
- `PolarAlignment/Dockables/DockablePolarAlignmentVM.cs`: imaging-tab tool wrapper. It instantiates the same `Instructions.PolarAlignment` class, blocks the camera while running, and exposes message-broker start/stop control.
- `PolarAlignment/TPAPAVM.cs`: long-lived UI/view-model for step state, reference-star tracking, overlays, continuous error updates, and `PolarErrorDetermination`.
- `PolarAlignment/Vector3.cs` and `PolarAlignment/RefractionParameters.cs`: core math helpers for vector transforms, Rodrigues rotation, and atmospheric defaults.
- `PolarAlignment/PolarAlignmentPlugin.cs`: plugin manifest plus settings bridge. It owns the selected automated adjustment system VM and the settings-backed option surface shown in `Options.xaml`.
- `tools/new_tppa_runtime_manifest.ps1` and `tools/validate_tppa_plugin_install.ps1`: the build/install provenance boundary. One pinned manifest binds source commit, plugin version, plugin DLL, and qualification-core DLL; guarded launchers accept only the manifest hash, never independently supplied DLL hashes.
- `PolarAlignment/UniversalPolarAlignmentBase.cs` and `UniversalPolarAlignmentBaseVM.cs`: shared serial-control and UI logic for remote adjustment hardware.
- `PolarAlignment/Avalon/*` and `PolarAlignment/OAPA/*`: concrete automated adjustment systems. Both rely on regex-parsed serial status strings and shared movement polling.
- `PolarAlignment/Options.xaml` and `PolarAlignment/Resources/PolarAlignmentInstructionTemplate.xaml`: most of the plugin UI is defined here.
- `PolarAlignment/FAQ.md` and `PolarAlignment/Changelog.md`: useful context when behavior looks odd but intentional.

## Runtime Flow

- `PolarAlignment.Execute(...)` stops guiding, optionally slews to the initial point, captures and solves three positions, computes declination spread from mount-reported Dec, and constructs `PolarErrorDetermination`.
- After the three-point solve, the code enters a continuous capture/solve/update loop that recomputes the current error against the chosen reference star.
- If an alignment system is selected, the plugin connects to it after the third measurement point.
- If automated adjustments are enabled, movement authority requires qualified fresh three-point geometry and settling. Every UPAS move is followed by an independent fresh three-point response; completion requires a further stationary fresh confirmation.
- The operational route has no elapsed-time veto. It stops after at most twelve
  freshly measured correction moves, or earlier on completion, cancellation,
  unsafe travel, invalid response, or regression. Runtime remains recorded for
  subsequent optimization toward the five-minute guideline.
- Validation lives in `PolarAlignment.Validate()`. If start behavior looks wrong in the dockable or the sequence item, inspect validation first.

## Message Broker Contracts

- Dockable start topic: `PolarAlignmentPlugin_DockablePolarAlignmentVM_StartAlignment`
- Dockable stop topic: `PolarAlignmentPlugin_DockablePolarAlignmentVM_StopAlignment`
- Progress topic: `PolarAlignmentPlugin_PolarAlignment_Progress`
- Error topic: `PolarAlignmentPlugin_PolarAlignment_AlignmentError`
- Pause topic: `PolarAlignmentPlugin_PolarAlignment_PauseAlignment`
- Resume topic: `PolarAlignmentPlugin_PolarAlignment_ResumeAlignment`

Treat these topic names as external contracts. Other plugins can subscribe to them.

## Build And Test

- Prefer Release for local build/test unless you explicitly want the debug deployment copy.
- Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` serially within a worktree. Concurrent
  invocations share WPF markup-compiler files under `PolarAlignment/obj` and
  can fail with `MC1000`/`UnauthorizedAccessException` while deleting
  `NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment_MarkupCompile.cache`; this is build contention,
  not a product regression.
- Debug builds run a post-build copy into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NINA\Plugins\3.0.0\Three Point Polar Alignment`.
- Typical commands:
  - `dotnet build PolarAlignment.sln -c Release`
  - `dotnet test NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment.Test\NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment.Test.csproj -c Release`
- The test project depends on the git submodule at `NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment.Test/External` for native dependencies.
- Bitbucket verification builds the complete solution and runs the WPF NUnit suite on a self-hosted Windows runner before publishing. The Linux packaging step also builds the complete solution so missing projects or untracked source moves cannot hide behind a plugin-only build.

## Council Bridges

- Codex-wide Claude/Gemini invocation and recovery are governed by
  `C:\Users\nnik0\.codex\bridge\COUNCIL_BRIDGE_RUNBOOK.md`. This repository
  adds TPPA-specific provenance and disclosure rules in
  `docs/COUNCIL_BRIDGE_RUNBOOK.md`.
- Before the first council call in a work session, run
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tools\test_council_bridges.ps1`.
- Pin every repository-aware review to
  `C:\Dev\upas-nina-tppa-plugin` and the full current commit. Reject output from
  any other root or checkpoint.
- Treat root and checkpoint as different kinds of gate. The **root is always a
  hard gate**: reject any seat whose tree is not the canonical root, because the
  stale-OneDrive failure mode is the reason this section exists. The
  **checkpoint must be captured at dispatch time**, never copied from an earlier
  brief, report, or chat message. HEAD moves quickly during active development,
  so a prompt that hard-codes an older commit makes both seats abort on a
  provenance mismatch and review nothing. When a review is deferred, scheduled,
  or re-run from a saved brief, require the seat to **report** the checkpoint it
  actually read and reject on mismatch only against the checkpoint captured for
  that run.
- Claude reviews use pinned `claude-opus-5` with `--effort high` in read-only
  plan/no-tools mode. Gemini reviews use Gemini 3.1 Pro High in read-only plan
  mode with a new project and explicit repository directory.
- A requested council is incomplete until both Claude and Gemini return
  substantive, provenance-verified answers. Repair and rerun a failed,
  incomplete, timed-out, or stale seat; never silently substitute or omit it.
- Do not call a seat "provenance-verified" when it had no way to look. Under the
  no-tools/inline-evidence doctrine a reviewer can only repeat the root and
  checkpoint the prompt gave it, which is exactly the failure mode the gate
  exists to catch. Choose explicitly per seat and record which was used:
  either grant that seat a narrow read-only rule scoped to the canonical root so
  it reads `.git\HEAD` and `.git\refs\heads\master` itself and quotes them, or
  keep it tool-free and label its answer **prompt-asserted provenance**, which
  does not satisfy the independent-verification requirement above.
- A headless Antigravity seat that lacks a matching `permissions.allow` rule
  auto-denies the tool and prints `jetski: no output produced ...` **while still
  exiting 0**. Never treat a zero exit code as seat success: assert on
  substantive content and the quoted provenance, not on exit status. In
  `permissions.allow`, a directory-prefix `read_file(<root>)` rule matches
  everything beneath it, whereas `command(...)` rules must match the exact
  command string, so prefer instructing that seat to use file reads only.
- After changing either Python bridge, restart Codex to reload the persistent
  MCP process, rediscover the tools, and rerun both functional pings.

## Current Repo Landmines

- The build currently emits `NU1701` warnings for `ToastNotifications` and `VVVV.FreeImage`. Those warnings are existing dependency noise, not necessarily a new regression.
- Several files still use obsolete command APIs (`RelayCommand`, `AsyncCommand`, `IAsyncCommand`). New code should prefer CommunityToolkit MVVM command types unless you are intentionally preserving the old pattern in touched files.
- The continuous correction path now depends on `ContinuousPolarErrorEstimator` and a time-aware topocentric forward model. Changes here are math-sensitive and should be backed by tests, not visual inspection alone.
- Settings still contain legacy booleans like `UseAvalonPolarAlignmentSystem` and `UseOAPAPolarAlignmentSystem`, but the active selection path is the enum-backed `SelectedPolarAlignmentSystem`.

## Editing Guidance

- Follow the existing code style in the touched file. Match naming, property patterns, command style, logging style, and local formatting before introducing new patterns.
- Keep line breaks consistent with the surrounding code. When editing wrapped expressions, object initializers, interpolated strings, or XAML attributes, preserve the local file's line-breaking style instead of reflowing unrelated code.
- When explanatory code comments are needed, prefer XML doc comments (`///`) on types and members over large blocks of regular inline comments. Use regular inline comments only when the explanation is truly local to a specific statement or block.
- When fixing a regression from an older working version, treat the old working code as the behavioral oracle. First identify the exact old-code invariant that must be preserved, then make the new code reproduce that observable behavior before considering cleanup or a more general abstraction.
- Tests for regressions must encode the old observable behavior, not just the new helper's internal math. If the old implementation and the new abstraction disagree, prefer a test that catches the user-visible regression.
- Treat all calculation and coordinate-transform changes as accuracy-sensitive. Do not make "close enough" math changes in polar-alignment, refraction, projection, or hardware-movement code.
- For formulas or math-sensitive transformations, verify the formula from a reliable source before changing behavior. Prefer primary or authoritative references when research is needed.
- If you are unsure about a formula, unit conversion, sign convention, coordinate frame, or hemisphere-specific behavior, ask instead of assuming.
- For drawing/overlay fixes, explicitly separate the physical/model coordinate, the image-space point being drawn, field motion versus star/sensor motion, and whether a selected reference star is a tracking anchor or part of the projection model.
- `TPAPAVM.BuildErrorDetailComputation` is legacy-sensitive. `ReferenceStarCoordinates` is used to reacquire/follow the selected star between frames. The error overlay uses the legacy correction parallelogram: project `PolarErrorDetermination.InitialReferenceFrame.Coordinates`, the full-correction destination, and the single-axis correction destinations; mirror them with `pointShift`; intersect the component lines through the current image center; then translate that drawing onto `ReferenceStar`. Do not replace this with direct residual projection or project the selected reference star through the continuous correction model unless intentionally changing UI behavior.
- Treat all user-facing text as accuracy-sensitive too. Tooltips, guides, changelog entries, and inline help must only say things you can support from the current code or a verified source.
- Do not add speculative recommendations, inferred behavior, or hardware advice to user-facing text unless it has been explicitly verified. If the implementation meaning is unclear, inspect the code first or ask.
- Any change in this repository must add a new topmost entry to `PolarAlignment/Changelog.md` and bump the plugin version in `PolarAlignment/NINA.Plugins.PolarAlignment.csproj` in the same change.
- If behavior differs between advanced-sequence execution and imaging-tab execution, start in `Instructions/PolarAlignment.cs`; both flows share it.
- If you change polar-error math, update the NUnit tests in the same change. The math code is concentrated in `TPAPAVM.PolarErrorDetermination`, `Position`, and `Vector3`.
- If you change automated adjustment behavior, review both the shared base classes and the concrete Avalon/OAPA implementations. The hardware layer is intentionally split into a shared transport/control base and thin system-specific classes.
- Preserve the settings pattern: when a user-facing property changes, the code usually writes to `Properties.Settings.Default` and immediately calls `CoreUtil.SaveSettings(...)`.
- Preserve message topic strings and serialized payload field names unless the change is explicitly a contract update.
- Be careful with serial-port changes. `UniversalPolarAlignmentBase` scans all COM ports, probes with `?`, and selects the first port whose status matches the system regex.
